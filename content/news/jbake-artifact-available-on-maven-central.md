## JBake artifact available on Maven Central

I'm pleased to announce that JBake v2.1 is now available on [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Corg.jbake%7Cjbake-core%7C2.1.1%7Cjar). 
Thanks go to [Aldrin Neal](https://twitter.com/aldrinleal) for helping guide me through the release process.

If you'd like to use JBake in your project then here's the dependency information you'll need:

`<dependency>
    <groupId>org.jbake</groupId>
    <artifactId>jbake-core</artifactId>
    <version>2.1.1</version>
</dependency>`

More news soon about the upcoming v2.2 release and maybe a little more on Maven.
